			 <p>I saw Peter Bogdanovich&rsquo;s 1972 film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072665/"><em>At Long Last Love</em></a> last night. It was a huge flop in its time, on the order of <em>Ishtar</em> or <em>Heaven&rsquo;s Gate</em>. It&rsquo;s currently undergoing a reevaluation, hampered mainly by the fact it&rsquo;s so hard to see (apparently the rights to the Cole Porter songs are a little suspect).  See Richard Brody&rsquo;s 2018 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/review-at-long-last-love-a-peter-bogdanovich-masterwork-that-was-despised-in-its-time"><em>New Yorker</em> review</a>.</p>
<p>I was lucky to attend a full-house screening at the Austin Film Society. In a year of <em>Hair</em> and <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest</em>, it must have felt like it cowardly avoided the current culture. But also avoided some of the problematic issues of 30s musicals and gave the women some agency.</p>

			 <p>LG has a USB-C 4K display with USB-A ports for a dock-like experience (I still prefer wired keyboard and Ethernet). The problem is, if you use USB-C for video, the USB-A ports operate at USB 2.0 speeds, and can&rsquo;t handle gigabit ethernet.</p>
<p>I found a Philips monitor with a similar design, with the key difference that it has a gigabit Ethernet port. So the USB-A can operate my keyboard at 2.0 speeds, and I get a single-cable connection for video, power and data. The drawback is that it delivers only 65w of power, and I&rsquo;d prefer 95w for my Macbook Pro.</p>

			 <p>I have two immediate reactions to micro.blog. The first is that it is a friendly and inviting. It feel less confrontational than the blue bird. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like people are trying to score points by dunking on others. The other reaction is that it feels smaller. I don&rsquo;t accidently encounter people talking about, say, Austin FC, or transportation planning.</p>
<p>Are the two related? Is it still an insular little community? What would it feel like if all the same micro-communities came over from the larger social media sites? Would I find those people as easily? What about if the trolls and bad actors arrived? Would it feel as suffocating and soul-sucking as the blue bird?</p>

			 <p>I give micro.blog a C- on <a href="https://brokaw.micro.blog/2021/08/15/code.html">code formatting</a>. The code block is monospace, but has no highlighting applied. The code block is wrapped in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;,</code> with the language captured as a <code>class</code> within <code>code</code>. That&rsquo;s enough to get a javascript syntax highlighter to work, but I&rsquo;m of the firm opinion that syntax highlighting should be a server-side operation. The lexer should wrap each language token in a CSS class, and let a stylesheet colorize the syntax.</p>

<p>The thing that brought me back is the way the micro posts and full blog posts are intermixed on the blog page. The looks and works the way I want. I never got my WordPress site working how I really wanted. I was hoping somebody would write a book (cough, cough) that might address how to self-host a similar site. At any rate, I&rsquo;m happy to pay for a hosted solution, as long as it does what I want, and it seems like micro.blog now does what I want.</p>
