         	<p>I have two immediate reactions to micro.blog. The first is that it is a friendly and inviting. It feel less confrontational than the blue bird. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like people are trying to score points by dunking on others. The other reaction is that it feels smaller. I don&rsquo;t accidently encounter people talking about, say, Austin FC, or transportation planning.</p>

<p>Are the two related? Is it still an insular little community? What would it feel like if all the same micro-communities came over from the larger social media sites? Would I find those people as easily? What about if the trolls and bad actors arrived? Would it feel as suffocating and soul-sucking as the blue bird?</p>

I&rsquo;m not a fan of the dark mode syntax on a light mode page, but whatever. The good news is that the syntax is highlighted using CSS classes. The bad news is that it doesn&rsquo;t appear to support Swift syntax.</p>

         	<p>I give micro.blog a C- on <a href="https://brokaw.micro.blog/2021/08/15/code.html">code formatting</a>. The code block is monospace, but has no highlighting applied. The code block is wrapped in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;,</code> with the language captured as a <code>class</code> within <code>code</code>. That&rsquo;s enough to get a javascript syntax highlighter to work, but I&rsquo;m of the firm opinion that syntax highlighting should be a server-side operation. The lexer should wrap each language token in a CSS class, and let a stylesheet colorize the syntax.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I wonder how code formatting works? Here are a couple of samples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc">#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	for (NSInteger i=1; I &lt;= 101; i++) {
		if (i % 15 == 0) {
		    NSLog(@&quot;FizzBuzz\n&quot;);
		} else if (i % 3 == 0) {
		    NSLog(@&quot;Fizz\n&quot;);
		} else if (i % 5 == 0) {
		    NSLog(@&quot;Buzz\n&quot;);
		} else {
		    NSLog(@&quot;%li\n&quot;, i);
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And Swift:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">for i in 1...100 {
    switch (i % 3, i % 5) {
    case (0, 0):
        print(&quot;FizzBuzz&quot;)
    case (0, _):
        print(&quot;Fizz&quot;)
    case (_, 0):
        print(&quot;Buzz&quot;)
    default:
        print(i)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing that brought me back is the way the micro posts and full blog posts are intermixed on the blog page. The looks and works the way I want. I never got my WordPress site working how I really wanted. I was hoping somebody would write a book (cough, cough) that might address how to self-host a similar site. At any rate, I&rsquo;m happy to pay for a hosted solution, as long as it does what I want, and it seems like micro.blog now does what I want.</p>
