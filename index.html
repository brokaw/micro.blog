         	<p>I have two immediate reactions to micro.blog. The first is that it is a friendly and inviting. It feel less confrontational than the blue bird. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like people are trying to score points by dunking on others. The other reaction is that it feels smaller. I don&rsquo;t accidently encounter people talking about, say, Austin FC, or transportation planning.</p>

<p>Are the two related? Is it still an insular little community? What would it feel like if all the same micro-communities came over from the larger social media sites? Would I find those people as easily? What about if the trolls and bad actors arrived? Would it feel as suffocating and soul-sucking as the blue bird?</p>

         	<p>I give micro.blog a C- on <a href="https://brokaw.micro.blog/2021/08/15/code.html">code formatting</a>. The code block is monospace, but has no highlighting applied. The code block is wrapped in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;,</code> with the language captured as a <code>class</code> within <code>code</code>. That&rsquo;s enough to get a javascript syntax highlighter to work, but I&rsquo;m of the firm opinion that syntax highlighting should be a server-side operation. The lexer should wrap each language token in a CSS class, and let a stylesheet colorize the syntax.</p>

         	<p>I wonder how code formatting works? Here are a couple of samples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-objc">#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	for (NSInteger i=1; I &lt;= 101; i++) {
		if (i % 15 == 0) {
		    NSLog(@&quot;FizzBuzz\n&quot;);
		} else if (i % 3 == 0) {
		    NSLog(@&quot;Fizz\n&quot;);
		} else if (i % 5 == 0) {
		    NSLog(@&quot;Buzz\n&quot;);
		} else {
		    NSLog(@&quot;%li\n&quot;, i);
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And Swift:</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">for i in 1...100 {
    switch (i % 3, i % 5) {
    case (0, 0):
        print(&quot;FizzBuzz&quot;)
    case (0, _):
        print(&quot;Fizz&quot;)
    case (_, 0):
        print(&quot;Buzz&quot;)

        print(i)

<p>‚Ä¶I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro‚Äôs great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ‚ÄúI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can‚Äôt agree with your methods of direct action‚Äù; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man‚Äôs freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‚Äúmore convenient season.‚Äù Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In the fall of 2020 I got Google Fiber.
For about $5 more than I was already paying to my local cable company, I got 5x the speed. I remain skeptical of Google as a company, and I hate trusting them with my privacy, but so far Google Fiber is a good deal.
Even better, though, is the discovery of the Ubiquiti <a href="https://www.ui.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/">Edgerouter X</a>.</p>
<p>Gigabit Ethernet made it necessary to upgrade my home router.
So instead of a consumer-grade plastic box of all-in-one router/switch/access point, I went for a small-business solution of the Edgerouter X.
It is purely a wired router, with gigabit internet and a four-port switch built in.
I added wireless network by pairing it with a Unifi access point.
The access point draws power from the Ethernet cable connected to the router.
The router and access point together require one power outlet, just like an all-in-one router.</p>
<p>The Edgerouter X has a web-based configuration assistant that will properly set up the router for 90% of the home users.
Some additional customization is available in the web admin, but really the best way to customize this router is by connecting with SSH and using the command line interface.</p>
<p>Having a separate access point and router is a bit like having separate stereo components, or a separate computer and monitor.
The freedom to mix and match makes it easier to match your exact requirements, and it gives me an incremental upgrade path.
I can upgrade them separately.</p>
<p>I am somewhat late to the Edgerouter X party.
It&rsquo;s been out for a few years, and the newer access points don&rsquo;t support the power over ethernet (PoE) that the Edgerouter X provides.
But for $140 for the pair, it a steal, and will probably power my house for another year or so, until the next upgrade appears.</p>

         	<p>By &#8220;next Silicon Valley, &#8221; I mean a runaway housing affordability disaster that prices out all the diversity and creativity that we value about Austin.</p>

<p>Michael Agresta at Texas Monthly is opimistic that Austin won&#8217;t repeat the same housing mistakes as San Francisco.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there‚Äôs one reason to be confident that Austin will not turn into the next Bay Area, it‚Äôs this: Austinites of all political types, from libertarian to social-justice-minded, have been warning each other for years that we don‚Äôt want to turn into the next San Francisco&#8230; there‚Äôs no chance we are sleepwalking through a reenactment of the past few decades of California history. For better or worse, what gets built here will be something brand-new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I could be as optimistic. That assumes that Austinites recognize and agree on what the mistakes of the Bay Area were. We may not sleep walk though it, but we seem to be courting disaster with our eyes wide open.</p>

         	<p>&#8220;Good riddance&#8221; seems to be a common sentiment towards 2020, but I can&#8217;t complain too much. I have my health. I have food and place to live. Nobody in my family got sick. Not everybody can say this. It did my best to stay healthy, but there are those who did the same and got sick regardless. Such is the nature of a virus.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not big on resolutions, but the new year is a natural time to stop and think about the year past and future. I developed some good habbits in the last year that I&#8217;m happy about: cooking, exercise. I need to build on that to turn it into tangible health gains, like weight loss. </p>

<p>Another goal is to write more, to post more here. I wrote sporadically in the last year. About 12 posts, or once a month. I hope to increase the frequency. </p>

<p>&#8220;Find a niche and stay focused&#8221; is common advice for blogging. It&#8217;s advice I&#8217;m going to ignore. I don&#8217;t expect a large readership. I don&#8217;t plan to make money. I&#8217;m free to write what I want. The only unifying theme is what I&#8217;m interested in. Maybe technology, or programming, or photography, or books, or movies, or transportation, or urban design. Maybe cats. Of course, cats.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all about small gains and incremental improvement. Nothing earth-shattering, just some improvements on past habits</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Emma Freer wrote a good retrospective on Austin&#8217;s successful 2020 light rail election in <a href="https://austonia.com/why-project-connect-passed">Austonia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike other races this election cycle, the results weren&#8217;t close. Prop A passed by a nearly 19% margin, which local political analysts and transit advocates attributed to record-breaking turnout, a younger electorate and a new approach to transit planning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new approach to transit planning is described by Christof Spieler. First, don&#8217;t be coy. If you&#8217;re proposing transit, go all in for transit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conventional wisdom used to be that a transit referendum would be more likely to pass if it appealed to transit skeptics, said Christof Spieler, a senior lecturer at the Rice University School of Architecture.</p>

<p>This was often achieved by limiting the amount of funding and bundling in spending for different kinds of infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing the 2020 plan to 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This time around, Capital Metro and city officials learned from past failures. Project Connect included more than seven times the investment and focused exclusively on transit, with two light rail lines, expanded bus service and other components.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, do the community outreach. Getting community groups involved and invested improved the plan, but it also included a bunch of activists who were influential in their communities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another key change, Spieler said, is the attention paid to advocacy groups and grassroots organizing.</p>

<p>Capital Metro reports that around 60,000 Austinites provided input on Project Connect, and advocates‚Äîsome of whom opposed the last ballot measure because they felt it did too little‚Äîwere more directly involved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those advocacy groups were a major voice in the creation of the plan and then rally their supporters to turn out to vote for it,&#8221; Spieler said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say that the 2014 plan died because of a bad map. But they developed a bad map because they studiously avoided involving any community groups. In the end, they had a bad map and no supporters.</p>

         	<p>In November 2020, Austin passed Proposition A, authorizing a $7.5 Billion transit expansion which includes rail. There have been various interpretations of why this succeeded. I&#8217;m not a transit or political expert, but I am an Austin resident who has been paying attention to transit issues since the initial, fateful 2000 loss. Here are my impressions of the various campaigns, and how we ended up passing the 2020 plan.</p>

<h2>The 2000 Referendum</h2>

<p>The 2000 loss was a true heart-breaker. It lost by less than 1%, fewer than 2000 votes. A couple of things that were in play that election:</p>

<p>The whole CapMetro area was voting on the plan, which added a lot of suburban voters. Central Austin really needed to perform to overcome those votes. </p>

<p>The anti-rail campaign had more traction in the central Austin electorate. <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2011-03-08/the-daily-hustle-3-8-11/">Max Nofziger</a> was still a respectable voice in local politics, and respected as an environmentalist. Climate change from automobile emissions felt less urgent then, and he led the charge against the plan, largely being a mouthpiece for South Congress merchants (i.e., Guerros) that rail would be bad for business. </p>

<p>Some potential advocates felt they could vote against this and get a monorail passed in a couple of years. It did feel like the plan was rushed to the polls, and there wasn&#8217;t the sense that all modes had been thoroughly considered.</p>

<p>With such thin margins, any of the above could have made a difference.</p>

<h2>Red Line 2004 Passes</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.trainsbusespeople.org">Trains, Buses, People</a>, Christof Spieler writes (something to the effect) that if nobody opposes your transit plan, it probably isn&#8217;t a very good plan. Pretty much nobody opposed the 2006 plan, which is why it passed.</p>

<p>The line runs on existing rail, so the capital cost seemed pretty cheap. It seemed like a good way to dip our toe in the water of light rail. In hindsight, it was the wrong idea. The line is slowly gaining ridership, but it isn&#8217;t the sort of smash success that makes people clamor for more. It will likely become a valuable element of the system after it connects to the orange, blue, and gold lines of project connect.</p>

<p>I often read that the 2020 election was Austin&#8217;s third try at rail, which ignores the 2006 election entirely. I think there is a sense in that this doesn&#8217;t count. It&#8217;s a commuter train, and doesn&#8217;t serve residents trying get around within the city. It also wasn&#8217;t a hard sell. Nobody was really asked to give up anything. The agency already owned the existing track. Even so, it&#8217;s relevant as a something that informs the typical Austinite&#8217;s perception of rail.</p>

<h2>The 2014 Referendum</h2>

<p>The 2014 referendum lost by a wide margin. Even transit advocates opposed the plan. Instead of addressing the densest areas, it was a speculative plan that tried to anticipate future growth by building in a corridor that was sparsely populated. The University of Texas played a part in ruining the line, as they wanted to encourage development along their eastern edge, since the western edge (where the 2000 and 2020 plans go) is already built out with some of the most historic buildings on campus. The western edge is also densest with residences, retail, and academic buildings. The 2014 plan ignored all that density. </p>

<p>Austin already had a rail line that had low ridership (the Red Line from 2004, opened in 2010), and the outsized operating budget of the line was a drain on the whole system. Transit supporters felt that the proposed line would perform poorly, drag the whole system down with it, and doom any additional rail investments for a long time. The secondary effect of this is that the plan was left without an army of community activists who would do the legwork it takes to push a citywide referendum over the finish line.</p>

<p>The 2014 failure is a best understood as a failure of leadership. It wasn&#8217;t messaging. It wasn&#8217;t pro-road sentiment. It wasn&#8217;t even anti-tax sentiment. I doubt a more transit-supportive electorate would have saved it. It was that the initial process ran amuck and ended up with a plan that served very few. </p>

<h2>2020 Success</h2>

<p>If the 2014 failure was a failure of leadership, I think it is fair to credit the city&#8217;s and Capital Metro&#8217;s leadership in the 2020 succes. The outreach was clearly superior. I had several feedback opportunities. CapMetro did the traditional forums at the community rec center, but they also did lots of virtual sessions (accelerated by COVID by the end). They seemed geared to take and incorporate feedback, rather than just present results.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the process, CapMetro seemed to be showing a worrying attraction to Autonomous Personal Rapid Transit, and other novel, unproven gadgets. I don&#8217;t know the story, but I like to think they were just doing due diligence. Maybe they knew these systems were unlikely to pan out, but they had to walk stakeholders through the decision process that leads to a system that can move tens of thousands of people in a space-constrained corridor. During the campaign rail opponents were full of promises of imminent technology we should just wait for. That sort of talk was much less resonant this time, and promises of non-existent autonomous vehicles, HyperLoop, monorail, and goldolas were not taken seriously. Maybe we got lucky, but the final plan was so solid that I suspect Cap Metro knew what they were doing all along.</p>

<p>The community engagement undoubtedly lead to a more equitable plan. As good as the 2000 plan was, it served very privileged parts of town and the distant suburbs. The only thing offered to the historically underserved east Austin was the promise that a central spine could improve the whole system. The 2020 plan incorporates east Austin into the core of the system with the blue line, rapid buses, and eventually a green line commuter rail.</p>

<p>The team apparently had the political space to pursue the best plan. My impression of 2014 is that Mayor Leffingwell didn&#8217;t do much to protect the transit team from political pressures. He might have even though he could harness those special interests to his advantage, without considering the damage they would do to good transit fundamentals. This time, the team seemed to address the project as a transit project, not as a development incentive. They haven&#8217;t shied away from proposing construction in a crowded, busy corridor. Construction on Guadalupe will be painful enough that plenty of Austin mayors have shied away from proposing building a rail line along that corridor. The Project Team felt empowered to suggest the best transit route.</p>

<p>In the end, pretty much any organization with political weight in Austin got behind the plan: business groups, multiple Democratic party groups, social justice groups. The anti-rail groups was reduced to car dealerships, the one-off local businesses (Guerro&#8217;s and Esther&#8217;s Follies), and the ever-present road-warrior crowd.</p>

<p>Austin had 20 years to reflect on the real costs of inaction. There is no option that improves automobile traffic within the city. Things are pretty densely built around narrow rights of way. There is no space to widen roads.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read about the demographic changes that drove much of the change. I don&#8217;t have much to add to that. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s true. I don&#8217;t know how it balances against, say, the equity elements of the plan. Or against the slow, methodical consensus building that resulted from community outreach. Or the scope and reach of the entire plan. But all of these are really part of the same thing. The plan is large, comprehensive, and equitable because of diligent public outreach and reacting to that feedback. </p>

<p>They all worked together, which enabled a $7.5 billion plan, funded by a tax increase, to be passed by a wide margin during a pandemic. It&#8217;s pretty amazing when you think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that when we talk about preserving neighborhoods as they exist right now, that means we‚Äôre excluding people from those neighborhoods, If we don‚Äôt develop in these neighborhoods, people build outward. That means the people most vulnerable to being displaced because of lack of affordability, they have to move further out of the city; they have less access to resources, they have more transportation costs to get to work, but also we as a city have to spend more money in infrastructure to build out so that people can access the city.</p>

<p>While we think that not developing in these neighborhoods is protecting the environment, the reality is sprawl is a huge environmental issue. We really need to think about how can we be more inclusive as a city and allow more people and more diverse people to live in the neighborhoods that exist so that everybody gets the opportunity to live that Austin experience and share in that neighborhood character.</p>

         	<p>iA Writer just <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/new-pdf-preview-better-web-publishing-improved-editing">updated to version 5.5</a>. This looks like a significant update, with one big feature that affects me: better support for self-hosted WordPress sites. Previous versions required the Jetpack plugin, which I <a href="https://steven.brokaw.org/posts/ulysses-vs-ia-writer">balked at using</a>. Now I can use the <a href="https://indieweb.org/WordPress_IndieAuth_Plugin">IndieAuth</a> <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">plugin</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/OAuth2">OAuth2 plugin</a> is also supported with a little more configuration.</p>

<p>This is my first post with iA Writer 5.5. It took me a couple of tries to get the plugin to work&#8211;documentation is scarce. But it works as advertised. Here&#8217;s hoping it leads to more posts here.</p>

         	<p>It seems like this advice comes along periodically: <em>Don&#8217;t use Markdown for technical documentation</em>.
Hillel Wayne is the most recent plea to hit hacker news, but there have been others.</p>

<p>Hillel Wayne, <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/please-dont-write-your-documentation-in-markdown/">Please don&#8217;t write your documentation in Markdown</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Markdown cannot carry data.
There&rsquo;s no way to imbue properties into text using markdown.
Good documentation is all about the semantic markup.
A &ldquo;definition&rdquo; is not just a different formatting or like.
It means there&rsquo;s actually a concept of a &ldquo;definition&rdquo; as a discrete concept in your documentation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Butterick, in <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/third-tutorial.html">Pollen: the book is a program</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is a limiting format for authors. Why? Because Markdown is merely shorthand notation for HTML tags. As such, it has three problems: it&rsquo;s not semantic, it only covers a limited subset of HTML tags, and it can&rsquo;t be extended by an author.</p>

<p>Though many people have added extensions to Markdown, almost none have any kind of semantic meaning. This means that you can&rsquo;t write a Class or a Warning, you can only write text.</p>

<p>Mister Gold, <a href="https://mister-gold.pro/posts/en/asciidoc-vs-markdown/">Stop Using Markdown For Documentation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Markdown you can only write text. It means that if you need to grab the reader&#8217;s attention with some kind of notes or tips, you have to embed HTML. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have focused on the lack of semantic data in all these criticisms, because I think it is the most important drawback. The lack of semantic meaning in markdown makes in unsuitable for many technical writing tasks. Yet, I still write in markdown. This post is in markdown. There are a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Its easy. I never forget the syntax. This may be because it is so limited, but it makes it easy to do simple documents.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s ubiquitous. The fact that there are so many different markdown parsers is not problem, its a strength. It&#8217;s usually trivial to add markdown to a system or workflow, regardless of the environment</li>
</ol>

<p>What are the alternatives?</p>

<p><a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html">ReStructurexText</a> &#8211; If I were writing a book, I would probably use ReStructuredText. It is extensible, so you can add your own &#8220;roles&#8221;. But the syntax is pretty hard to remember. For example, here is the image syntax:</p>

<pre><code>.. image:: images/biohazard.png
    :height: 100
    :width: 200
    :scale: 50
    :alt: alternate text
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the benefit is that the image tag <em>has</em> a height, width, and scale: something few markdown parsers support. It&#8217;s heavily tied to Python, which is something I&#8217;m comfortable with. It&#8217;s also heavily tied to a single implementation in <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io">docutils</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://asciidoctor.org">AsciiDoc</a> &#8211; The syntax is more in the spirit of markdown. It seems to have coalesced around a Ruby implementation, and left the original <a href="http://asciidoc.org">python implementation</a> languishing<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. I was unhappy with the HTML produced by asciidoctor is styled entirely by <code>div</code> tags. Title ; just styles applied to named <code>div</code> tags.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/">Pollen</a> &#8211; Very nice system. The fact it requires Racket is both admirable and a real-world pain. I gave up after trying to write my own pollen command. Trying to debug the unexpected return type from a nested <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/plait/s-exp-tutorial.html">s-expresion</a> did me in.</p>

<p>For now, I stay with markdown, and all it&#8217;s shortcomings.</p>

         	<p>In the spirit of supporting our local business during the pandemic, we signed up for a cheese-tasing course with <a href="https://www.antonellischeese.com">Antonelli&#8217;s</a>. We picked up a half pound of cheese from their shop: a pre-selected sampling of seven different cheeses. Then we embellished it with a little prosciutto, Castelvetrano olives, a baguette, and some wine. We then tuned into their video stream while they talked us through the full tasting menu. It was great, especially considering they had never streamed a tasting before and rushed into it with about a week&#8217;s preparation.</p>

         	<p>One thing I noticed during these coronavirus work-at-home days is how absolutely sedentary I am when working from home. I&#8217;ve worked from home in other jobs, but I <em>really</em> notice it now. My Apple Watch detects essentially zero exercise, and very little activity. At work, all the small trips to the water fountain, to the restroom, to the cafeteria, they all add up. They don&#8217;t close my rings, but they at least make it look like I did something besides sit on my butt all day. At home all of those little trips are about 20 feet away, max.</p>

<p>In the last few days I&#8217;ve been making an effort to get out and close my exercise ring. I no longer have a commute, so that gives me an extra 45 minutes to an hour I can devote to exercise. I&#8217;ve been getting my rings closed, and breaking free of the stay-at-home ennui.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>While I&#8217;m on the topic of WordPress, I found a new hosting provider. I run a small family site. Even though it&#8217;s small, it has a lot of specific needs: </p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s very image-heavy, so it needs lots of storage space</li>
<li>I need to send out email notifications at various events</li>
<li>Users need to be able to post by sending email</li>
<li>It needs to be robust and reliable, so I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time chasing down issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#8217;ve tried various hosted solutions. Wordpress.com was hosting it for a while. At some point, they made changes to their user profile settings, and some users were having issues I couldn&#8217;t help them with. I moved to self-hosted so that I had enough control to address these issues. Besides, our disk usage was growing and I was likely to get priced out of the free plan.</p>

<p>There are several shared plans that I looked into. They often come with an email serve I can use, but my experience with them hasn&#8217;t been great. Running a DigitalOcean droplet works great, until it doesn&#8217;t. Then it takes all Saturday to figure out what&#8217;s goin on. There is a next tier of plans that help you manage a VPS. <a href="http://serverpilot.io">ServerPilot</a> and <a href="https://runcloud.io">RunCloud</a> are a couple of examples. They help with the setup of the web server and database, but after that, you&#8217;re on your own. They don&#8217;t have a mail server, and only the foolhardy run their own mail server. Then I found <a href="https://www.cloudways.com/en/">CloudWays</a>. It does all the stuff ServerPilot and RunCloud do, but they also offer mail server add-on. For $1/month, I can add a RackSpace mailbox. I use this for incoming post-by-email traffic. Then for a few cents per 1000, they offer an outgoing SMTP server. I could (and have) patched this all together with a service like <a href="https://www.migadu.com/en/index.html">Migadu</a>. But having it integrated with the server is a big plus.</p>

         	<p>Well, here I am, with a new theme. I&#8217;m giving <a href="https://generatepress.com">GeneratePress</a> a whirl after discovering it on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wordpress">WordPress subreddit</a>. I want a pretty simple, text-heavy site. I don&#8217;t have a store, a shopping cart, or any heavy layout needs. My main interest is fonts and typography, and this gives me enough control. I can also tweak various layout elements as much as I need.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a pretty capable free versions, I paid the $50 for the pro upgrade. That pricing is perfect: it makes me reasonably confident the theme will be supported and upgraded, but it&#8217;s cheap enough for a hobby site with no income.</p>

<p>If you looking for more like this, <a href="https://wpastra.com/">Astra</a> is another one that came up, with a similar pricing structure. I don&#8217;t have a particularly good reason to choose GeneratePress over Astra. I think it was partly that the pricing and the product info gave me the impression their market is individual bloggers, whereas Astra is trying to address agencies and WordPress freelancers. Like I said, not a great reason, but they both looked good, and I need some basis to make a decision. Hopefully there is no <em>Take Two</em> sequel to this post, but if there is, it will probably be Astra.</p>

<li>Support latest standards like micro formats</li>
<li>Responsive, but no hamburger menus in the full size view</li>

         	<p>Depending on the map you look at, the Orange line is either a 21 mile route from Howard Lane to Slaughter Lane, or&ndash;if you ignore the parts marked &ldquo;future expansion&rdquo;&ndash;an 11 mile route that runs from North Lamar transit center to Stassney. In either case, the midsection of the line runs through the center of town via Lamar, Guadalupe, and South Congress.</p>
<p>According to Capital Metro, the 6.5 mile segment from Koenig to Oltorf is under consideration for grade separation, such as subway or elevated. Should it be? That is the question posed to the community.</p>
<p>Some of the tradeoffs presented are construction cost, right-of-way fit, and travel speed. Cost and political viability were not explicitly under consideration by the transportation engineers.</p>
<p>Sticking with the transit considerations: Guadalupe near 29th is particularly narrow and difficult to fit two dedicated lanes of transit in addition to the existing two lanes of car traffic. Even giving up the middle chicken lane and the parking makes things tight.</p>
<p>How sacred are the lanes of car drivers currently on Guadalupe. Mayor Adler has named them a priority. The transit engineers at the meeting seemed more accepting of talking about trade-offs, whatever those were.</p>
<p>So what about the price of the options offered? Jerry Smiley was hesitant to offer a concrete metric. <em>Site-specific</em> was his favorite term to temper desires for specific numbers. </p>
<p>In general, elevated and CNC are more than surface; tunneling is more expensive than any others. But the scale factor was highly site-specific. Sometimes cut and cover can run into problems that it would have been easier and cheaper to just bore underneath.</p>
<p>There was less discussion around route and station selection. In general the route was deemed sane, and far better than the route offered to (and declined by) residents in 2014. The local 1 bus will probably still run the length of Lamar-Guadalupe. The stops will be more frequent, and the bus will be stuck in traffic the way they are today.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://brokaw.micro.blog/2019/07/07/ulysses-vs-ia.html">Ulysses vs. iA Writer</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&#8217;ve been looking for a serious writing program. Maybe <em>serious</em> isn&#8217;t the right word, because I use Vim and BBEdit, and those are nothing if not serious. But they don&#8217;t feel right for the type of concentrated, long-form prose that I am trying to write. The contenders that I settled on are iA&nbsp;Writer and Ulysses.</p>

<p>Both are great, and I would recommend either. Choosing between them is more about your personal preferences, workflow, and writing needs. My observations based on my particular needs are below.</p>

<p>You should also check out the comparison by <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-environment-ia-writer-vs-ulysses-358c95d07bd5/">Marius Masalar</a>.</p>

<h2>Comparison</h2>

<p>This is not comprehensive, just a few things that happen to be important to me.</p>

<h3>Post to Wordpress</h3>

<p>Ulysses posts to self-hosted Wordpress installations.</p>

<p>iA Writer requires Jetpack for self-hosted Wordpress.</p>

<p>I have no desire to install Jetpack, so this is a drawback to iA Writer. Ulysses works exactly the way I want it to.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Starting with <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/new-pdf-preview-better-web-publishing-improved-editing">iA Writer 5.5</a>, Wordpress posting on personal sites<a href="https://steven.brokaw.org/posts/ulysses-vs-ia-writer"> has been improved</a>.</p>

<h3>File Management</h3>

<p>iA Writer works on files. Ulysses works on &#8220;sheets,&#8221; a file abstraction that lives in a database owned by the application.</p>

<p>Both approaches have their advantages. iA Writer&#8217;s advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>The files are <strong>searchable with Spotlight</strong>. Using Finder to search for things will reveal your iA Writer files just as well as searching within iA Writer.</li>
<li>The files are <strong>portable</strong>. It is easy and immediate to edit the files in another program. I can use BBEdit or Vim to open a file I created in iA Writer without having to export.</li>
<li>I can keep the files in a <strong>git repository</strong>. iCloud probably serves most writers&#8217; needs, but if you&#8217;re a git user, having your history in a repository is reassuring.</li>
</ul>

<p>The downside is that I am doing my own file management. I have to decide what to name a new document. I have to decide where to save my file. These little decisions can slow me down.</p>

<p>By contrast, Ulysses works with a container that manages the files for me. The benefit of this is that no file name or folder location is required when I create a file (or &#8220;sheet&#8221;). Just &#x2318;N and I&#8217;m ready to write.</p>

<p>It also easy to compose a work of many sheets. It lets me think in sentences and paragraphs instead of files. I can combine sheets, rearrange their order, &#8220;glue&#8221; sheets together, and split them apart. It&#8217;s more flexible and useful than iA Writer&#8217;s &#8220;content blocks.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Fonts and Appearance</h3>

<p>Ulysses has a very detailed preference pane to customize every element of my Markdown syntax. I can create themes, and I can use themes created by others. Ulysses comes with a solarized theme, so I picked that. Then I noticed that there is another solarized theme: slightly different and more in line with what markdown looks in MacVim. So I changed to that. After a while, that started to feel garish, so I switched to a theme that mimics Editorial. This was great. But now that theme is starting to look a little&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;too subdued, maybe. I&#8217;ll find something I like if I keep looking. If not, there&#8217;s a way to create custom theme styles&#8230;</p>

<p>iA Writer looks great. There is a setting for light or dark. There is a font setting with three choices. I picked the one I like and haven&#8217;t given it much thought since. I feel none of the theme malaise that Ulysses makes me feel.</p>

<h3>Markdown</h3>

<p>iA Writer is straight markdown, more or less. More textual than Ulysses, anyway. That is, a link in iA Writer looks exactly like you would expect:</p>

<pre><code>[Link anchor text](http://example.com/path/to/target.html)
</code></pre>

<p>Ulysses has clever little additions that make it less textual and more graphical. The target URL is not listed in the source view. If you double-click on the link text, a little inspector window opens to show the target link. It&#8217;s very well done, but I feel the textual nature of markdown is a benefit, and Ulysses loses that.</p>

<h3>Share Extension</h3>

<p>Ulysses has a (poor) Safari share icon. It can paste a web site title and URL, and that&#8217;s about it. It is no match for Bear or Keep It.</p>

<p>iA Writer has no service or share extension.</p>

<h2>(Preliminary) Decision</h2>

<p>I like iA Writer better. Even though Ulysses does have real advantages, iA Writer just <em>feels</em> better. I like the fonts and the built-in preview styles. I like the more standard, textual markdown source. I like the options for previewing the rendered markdown.</p>

<p>The file handling goes both ways. I can totally get behind Ulysses&#8217; philosophy, but I like having my content indexed in Spotlight.</p>

<p>I love that Ulysses can post directly to my WordPress blog. I get around this iA Writer deficiency by using Byword to open the file created by iA Writer and posting from there. This workaround may become tiresome, but for now it works.</p>

<p>This comes down largely to aesthetics and intangible preferences.</p>

<h2>Potential Game Changers</h2>

<p>These are things that might tip my decision the other way, after more time using them.</p>

<ul>
<li>WordPress posting. Ulysses just does WordPress posting the way I want.</li>
<li>File management. I can see myself coming to prefer Ulysses&#8217; style after a spending more time with both.</li>
<li>Writing Goals. Ulysses can track writing goals, both daily, and set per sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-issues</h2>

<p>iA Writer has a feature that will highlight words based on parts of speech (nouns, verbs, etc.). I don&#8217;t find this useful.</p>

<p>Many are outraged by the subscription pricing of Ulysses. It doesn&#8217;t bother me. It is useful how a single subscription gives me access to macOS and iOS versions of the app. If I start writing more with my my iPad, this might be useful.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>My recommendation is that you can&#8217;t decide, get both. You can get a week&#8217;s trial of both. If that isn&#8217;t enough time, just buy iA Writer, and buy a monthly subscription to Ulysses. Give yourself a couple of months to settle into them both. One will reveal itself as your favorite.</p>

<p>This is what I&#8217;m doing. I prefer iA&nbsp;Writer, but Ulysses has clear advantages. I want to live with both and see which feels better over the long term. There might be drawbacks to iA Writer that get annoying only over time. When I make a final decision, I&#8217;ll post an update.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One thing that is guaranteed to make people feel negative about living in a city is a constant sense of being lost or disorientated. Some cities are easier to navigate than others &mdash; New York‚Äôs grid-like street pattern makes it relatively straightforward, whereas London, with its hotchpotch of neighbourhoods all orientated differently and the Thames meandering through the middle, is notoriously confusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can speak to neither New York (which I found confusing), nor to London, but the Hyde Park neighborhood is one of Austin&rsquo;s more walkable neighborhoods, and it is built on a pretty rigid grid.</p>

         	<p>I wanted a new fountain pen that would better fit my passport-sized Midori Traveller notebook. I&#8217;ve been using a Pilot Metropolitan and a Platinum Preppy. The Metropolitan is a little too fat. The Platinum fits better, but the clear plastic dresses down the Traveller. The Kaweco Classic Sport is a short, pocketable fountain pen that has a barrel that looked like it might fit inside the Midori pen loop without a clip (the Sport doesn&#8217;t come with a clip). The pen writes great. The fit in the notebook is okay, but not perfect. You can see how lose it is in the photo below. With a little help with the elastic band, it&#8217;s okay. I got the plastic version of the Sport, so I don&#8217;t worry about losing it as much as much as I would with a nicer pen.</p>

         	<p>It&#8217;s common for a movie to have two-dimensional characters, poorly acted, placed in a riveting plot. The <em>Star Wars</em> comes to mind. It&#8217;s somewhat more rare for well acted and complex characers to be placed in a manifestly ridiculous plot. But that&#8217;s what <em>Choose Me</em> is.
The plot feels like it owes a debt to <em>Three&#8217;s Company</em> in that the most improbably coincidences place characters in one another&#8217;s bedrooms. But somehow, the characters make it all work. Keith Carradine plays Micky, a mental patient who either escaped or was released from his institution. It&#8217;s not explained which. Nor is it explained whether he is a pathological liar or a former spy. Or a romantic or a creep.</p>

<p>Mickey lives in LA and hangs out at a bar named &#8220;Eve&#8217;s.&#8221; He mainly hits on two female roomates.
One roomate is a host of call-in radio sex counsellor. The other roommate owns the bar and is a frequent caller of the radio show. Somehow, neither of the roommates realizes they are talking to each other on this call-in show. You might thing the distictive accent of the radio host would be a tip off. </p>

<p>Describing the plot of the movie makes it sound far more ridiculous than it is. The characters are all neurotic to some extent, and the movie is entirely about their interactions. Just accept the plot as a given, and try to pick out whether the mental patient is really a lover; wheter the sex therapist finds her first love; and wheter the jaded bar owner settles down for a one-man committment. </p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today&#8217;s movie is <em>Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll High School</em>. It a it is an updated, punk-rock version of a Frankie and Annette teen romp, just as the Ramones are an updated version of 60&#8217;s pop. And while the Ramones are legit punk, it is too sweet and good natured to feel truly disreputable. That is probably it&#8217;s biggest charm. None of the students are really ruining their lives.</p>

<p>The story belongs to two girls: Riff Randall, who thinks school is a drag and just wants to have fun, and her smart friend Kate Rambeau. Kate is apparently on track to be valedictorian but keeps getting in trouble by hanging tight with Riff. It&#8217;s like Lindsay from <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> never stopped hanging out with Millie, her mathlete friend. Another break with expected types is the high school star quarterback: he is neither the villian nor a hero. He&#8217;s just another dull high school boy who doesn&#8217;t know how to talk to girls.</p>

<p>The Ramones play a concert, and while it isn&#8217;t really concert footage but it&#8217;s great band footage regardless. It was probalby about the most serious thing in the movie. Consisering they played a song about Pinhead at a concert attended by a six foot mouse, that sets a low bar for seriousness.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I saw <em>Return of the Secaucus 7</em> as part of Richard Linklater&#8217;s <em>Jewels in the Wasteland</em> series at the Austin Film Society. This is often described as &#8220;The Little Chill,&#8221; as it is generally recognized being a spiritural successor to <em>The Big Chill</em>, a movie I viscerally hated when it came out. Secaucus 7 is populated by a group of more sympathetic people. The idealists went on to become teachers, doctors, drug abuse counselors.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a talky, actorly movie, and the best scenes are dialog: Three guys recite a perfectly timed ensemble of a motor sports commercial: &#8220;Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! At Washington Valley Speedway: thrills, chills, and spills!&#8221; Another scene has a woman vomiting off screen in another room, while to guys try to figure out who it is based on the sounds. &#8220;No, Maura more of a ralpher.&#8221;</p>

<p>It kind of makes me wonder how I&#8217;d react to <em>The Big Chill</em> now.</p>

<p>On a side-note, Linklater revealed that the big money in Hollywood is in rewrites. When a multi-million production is scheduled to start and they have script problems, they&#8217;re willing to shell out a boatload of money for a week of work. Apparenly Sayles is a writing machine, makes a living this way, and rolls much of the money into is indie projects.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve gone back and forth from static site generators, like Jekyll and Hugo, to hosted
sites like Wordpress, which is the current platform. One of the benefits of static site
generators is the ability to write posts in markdown and keep my content in a git
repository. The advantage of Wordpress is the ecosystem around it. There is a plugin for
just about everything, and good themes are easy to find.</p>
<p>This is my latest attempt to have my cake and eat it too. I wrote a script to turn a
markdown file into HTML and post the result to Wordpress. I don&rsquo;t have a good way to post
photos, and I don&rsquo;t have a way to update the post. At this this will help me see if the
writing method was really hindering my posting, or whether that was just an excuse.</p>

A couple of years ago we were at the Yard Dog for the cheap Lagunitas and the Jon Langford show. We got an entire day of great music, including Churchwood.

I have scripts in progress that can read YAML front-matter and create a new post using the Title, date, category, etc. from the front-matter. So as a text-publishing solution, BBEdit is pretty complete. Or will be once I finish those scripts. The problem is with images. I don&rsquo;t have a good solution for images, and I don&rsquo;t have a good plan on how to deal with them.</p>

<p>One possible solution is MarsEdit. I&rsquo;ve been a registered owner for years and have always wanted it to work for me. MarsEdit allows for a custom script to render markdown into HTML. The difficulty I&rsquo;m coming against now is getting my Python markdown scripts to work. MarsEdit executes its scripts in a restricted environment, so it can&rsquo;t load the libraries.</p>

In emails to employees at Apple, Bloomberg&rsquo;s Ben Elgin has requested &ldquo;discreet&rdquo; input on the alleged hack. &ldquo;My colleagues&rsquo; story from last month (Super Micro) has sparked a lot of pushback,&rdquo; Elgin wrote on Nov. 19 to one Apple employee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asked to join the research effort here to do more digging on this &hellip; and I would value hearing your thoughts (whatever they may be) and guidance, as I get my bearings.&rdquo;</p> <p>One person who spoke with Elgin told the Erik Wemple Blog that the Bloomberg reporter made clear that he wasn&rsquo;t part of the reporting team that produced &ldquo;The Big Hack.&rdquo; The goal of this effort, Elgin told the potential source, was to get to &ldquo;ground truth&rdquo;; if Elgin heard from 10 or so sources that &ldquo;The Big Hack&rdquo; was itself a piece of hackery, he would send that message up his chain of command. The potential source told Elgin that the denials of &ldquo;The Big Hack&rdquo; were &ldquo;100 percent right.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote></p>

         	<p>Scott meyeres is one of the <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/effective-c-plus-plus-55-specific-ways-to-improve-your-9780321334879">foremost</a> <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/more-effective-c-plus-plus-35-new-ways-to-improve-your-9780201633719">experts</a> on <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/effective-stl-50-specific-ways-to-improve-your-use-9780201749625">C++</a>. He recently <a href="http://scottmeyers.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-errata-evaluation-problem.html">had this to say</a> regarding bug reports on the code in his books.</p> <blockquote> <p>I retired from active involvement in C++ at the end of 2015, and in the ensuing two and  a half years, I‚Äôve forgotten enough details of the language that I am no longer able to  properly evaluate bug reports regarding the technical aspects of my books. C++ is a  large, intricate language with features that interact in complex and subtle ways, and I  no longer trust myself to keep all the relevant facts in mind.</p> </blockquote> <p>In case you don&rsquo;t know him, he&rsquo;s not particularly old (born 1959, which makes him 59 as of this writing), and in good health as far as I know. So this is a statement about the complexity of C++, and not about Scott Meyers, who is still as sharp and brilliant as the day he retired.</p> <p>One of the criticisms of C++ has always been its complexity. There are so many &ldquo;gotchas,&rdquo; special cases, and unexpected side-effects that it seems impossible that a single person could keep it all in her head. This seems like a good illustration of the extent to which that is true.</p>

         	<p>We recently cancelled our cable TV. We&rsquo;re an Apple household, so we get most our stuff from AppleTV apps now. In addition to the usual Netflix and Amazon, here&rsquo;s what we use.</p> <p><strong>iTunes</strong>: We purchased episodes of <em>The Expanse</em> (which airs on SyFy) on iTunes. We&rsquo;ll have to do the same thing if we want to watch <em>Better Call Saul</em>. That, or wait for it to come on Netflix.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.silicondust.com/product/hdhomerun-duo/">HDHomeRun</a></strong>: This is a TV tuner with an Ethernet port. An app on the AppleTV streams the video. This is working great for local broadcast channels. We use it the occasional live sports broadcast, a few network shows (<em>The Good Place</em> and <em>Saturday Night Live</em> come to mind), the BBC stuff that airs on PBS, and whatever else might show up on broadcast.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://getchannels.com/dvr/">Channels DVR</a></strong>: This works with the HDHomeRun and runs on my QNAP NAS (which I already had). It writes the digital broadcast stream to the NAS and comes with an AppleTV app which ties it all together. The same app can either stream the broadcast from the tuner, or stream recorded shows from the NAS. The DVR service costs $8/month, which give you the schedule data and the ability to sechedule a season pass, etc. The price is on the high side for comparable services. There&rsquo;s no contract, so I can switch if I figure out a better service.</p> <p>I tried Hulu, both with and without the live TV option. Neither one was completely satisfactory. For example, I didn&rsquo;t watch the first episode of <em>The Good Place</em> Season 2 soon enough, and it becase unavailable. A broadcast show unavailable? What am I paying for? That won&rsquo;t be a problem if I record a broadcast off my HDHomeRun.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s one more service we use that isn&rsquo;t generally available&ndash;membership to the <a href="https://www.austinfilm.org">Austin Film Society</a>. They have a membership level that comes with free movie tickets for a montly fee. We live a few minutes away from their new theater, and we average about two films a week.</p> <p>What&rsquo;s missing is premium cable. We have no HBO or Showtime. If we had HBO, we would have watched the latest season of <em>Silicon Valley</em> and <em>Westworld</em>. There&rsquo;s enough other stuff on that I can&rsquo;t say I miss it too much. When <em>Game of Thrones</em> comes on, we will subscribe to HBO Now, but until then we have plenty of stuff to watch.</p>

         	<p>As everyone knows, the number one reason for poor craftsmanship is poor tools. To that end, I am addressing my poor blogging output by changing the blogging platform. I have moved from Wordpress to Jekyll.</p>
<p>Joking aside, WordPress is powerful in lots of ways, but it does require care and feeding. For a business website, I would spend money on dedicated WordPress hosting that takes care of it. For a personal site, I don&rsquo;t want to spent the money, nor do I want to spend the time to do it myself.</p>
<p>So here I am with a new <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> site. Most of the content is ported over, but not all of it came over cleanly. There&rsquo;s some mangled posts. Also, I still have to find a solution to move the images over. Things may appear a bit under construction for a while.</p>

         	<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to research web hosting, you&#8217;re probably noticed the disreputable nature of hosting reviews. Most review sites are riddled with affiliate links, which calls into question all the reviews and ratings.</p>

<p>When I was shopping for managed WordPress hosting, one site I&#8217;ve come to trust is Review Signal. They now have a <a href="https://reviewsignal.com/blog/wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2018/">2018 edition of their WordPress hosting benchmarks</a>. I have a <a href="https://lightningbase.com">Lightning Base</a> account based on their recommendation, and I&#8217;m very happy with it. I had never heard about the company before I read about them in Review Signal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also tried <a href="https://pressable.com">Pressable</a>. They rank highly, and their interface was nicer than Lighting Base. They are also a Texas comany. But I only have one site I really need top-tier hosting for, and Lightning Base had better pricing for that use case.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big <em>Game of Thrones</em> fan, but never heard of Ed Sheeran, much less knew his face or voice. The thing that stuck out at me was not the extraneous singing, but the excessive <em>niceness</em> of the Lannister soldiers. There is no precedent for a crew of such squeaky-clean soldiers. That was outrageous. But the Ed Sheeran cameo? That fit right in.</p>

         	<p>If you saw David Lynch&#8217;s <em>Mullholland Falls</em> and thought, &#8220;too conventional,&#8221; then <em>Funeral Parade of Roses</em> is a film for you. Describing it as a transsexual love triange set in 60&#8217;s Japan makes it appear more conventional than it is. It pulls just about every cinematic trick in the book and runs them through a narrative blender. The nonlinear narrative removes any orientation the viewer might hope for at the beginning of each scene. Some scenes seem to fit the narrative, only to be revealed as movie sets by a crew of young film radicals making a movie about transsexuals. An argument between two characters is shown in on-screen speech bubbles. Fights are sped up, Benny-Hill style, complete with organ circus music. It ends with a revalation of incest and gory visuals of a transsexual blinding herself with a knife.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last night&#8217;s move at the Austin Film Society: <em>After the Fox</em>. Peter Sellers plays a master criminal who stages a bogus movie production to smuggle a load of stolen gold into Italy. Directed by an Italian, set and filmed in Italy, partially dubbed in English, starring Peter Sellers as an Italian, speaking English with an Italian accent. Oh, and a script by a budding Neil Simon. It&#8217;s kind of a weird mish-mash that probably couldn&#8217;t exist today, but somehow seems natural coming from the 60&#8217;s.</p>

<p>All this manages to fit perfectly with the ridiculous tone of Sellers hoodwinking an entire Italian village that he is a famous Italian director. It&#8217;s a <em>movie-making-fun-of-movies</em> movie, with an aging Hollywood has-been and Italian movie industry serving as the butt of the jokes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the 1990s, two amateur historians, Neil Howe and the late William Strauss, developed a new theory of American history in two books, Generations: the History of America&rsquo;s Future (1991), and The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy (1997). They identified an 80-year cycle in American history, punctuated by great crises that destroyed an old order and created a new one.</p>
<p>The great crises identified by Strauss and Howe included the era of the American Revolution and the Constitution (1774-1794); the Civil War and its immediate aftermath (1860-68); and the Depression and the Second World War (1929-45). Doing the math, they predicted another great crisis sometime in the first 15 years of the 21st century.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On discussing the Howe and Strauss theory with Stephen Bannon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than once during our interview, [Bannon] pointed out that each of the three preceding crises had involved a great war, and those conflicts had increased in scope from the American Revolution through the Civil War to the Second World War. He expected a new and even bigger war as part of the current crisis, and he did not seem at all fazed by the prospect.</p>

<p>It was an audacious pitch. No matter what you may think, the American-born Mr. Awlaki told Western Muslims, sooner or later your governments and fellow citizens will come after you. So you must join our violent cause.</p>

<p>Now, Donald Trump does his best to prove him right. I&rsquo;m sure ISIS recruiters everywhere are celebrating. Luckily, it appears they are receiving substantial support from their fellow citizens.</p>

         	<p>Today an item scrolled by on my Facebook feed that alleges evidence of 800,000 illegal votes in the 2016 election. The source of the article was the highly partisan Sean Hannity, quoting a <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/26/hillary-clinton-received-800000-votes-from-nonciti/">Washington Times piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political scientist Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, has worked with colleagues to produce groundbreaking research on noncitizen voting, and this week he posted a blog in response to Mr. Trump&rsquo;s assertion.
Based on national polling by a consortium of universities, a report by Mr. Richman said 6.4 percent of the estimated 20 million adult noncitizens in the U.S. voted in November. He extrapolated that that percentage would have added 834,381 net votes for Mrs. Clinton, who received about 2.8 million more votes than Mr. Trump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided chase down this study. Here was what I found with just a little bit of effort searching Google for <a href="https://fs.wp.odu.edu/jrichman/2017/01/27/i-do-not-support-the-washington-times-piece/">Jesse Richman</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a primary author cited in this piece, I need to say that I think the Washington Times article is deceptive. It makes it sound like I have done a study concerning the 2016 election. I have not. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has more explanation of his method, and a link to the original article quoted in the Times piece. As a bounus, his original study has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/27/methodological-challenges-affect-study-of-non-citizens-voting/">serious methodological shortcoming</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a bigger problem with utilizing CCES data to make claims about the non-citizen voting in the United States is that some respondents might have mistakenly misreported their citizenship status on this survey (e.g. response error)&hellip; In fact, any response error in self-reported citizenship status could have substantially altered the authors&rsquo; conclusions because they were only able to validate the votes of five respondents who claimed to be non-citizen voters in the 2008 CCES.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a reminder to use your build-in BS detector, or at least try a little Googling.</p>

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&rsquo;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &ldquo;order&rdquo; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: &ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>

         	<p>Via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/29/fleishman-curly-quotes">Daring Fireball</a>, Glenn Fleishman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/quotation-mark-wars/511766/">Atlantic article on curly quotes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trouble with being a former typesetter is that every day online is a new adventure in torture. Take the shape of quotation marks. These humble symbols are a dagger in my eye when a straight, or typewriter-style, pair appears in the midst of what is often otherwise typographic beauty. It&rsquo;s a small, infuriating difference: "this" versus &ldquo;this.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I write my content in Markdown, render it to HTML, and post raw HTML into WordPress. It&rsquo;s a couple extra steps, but I get to write in a proper text application, and the output is reliable and well-formed. During that process the quotes are &ldquo;educated&rdquo; to transfrom plain ASCII inch marks to proper double quotes.</p>
<p>Ironically, the quote above is the biggest problem I&rsquo;ve encountered in a while: the plain quotes are automatically educated, so I have to update the HTML output and change it back. Then I discovered that <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wptexturize">WordPress automatically educates my quotes</a>, so I couldn&rsquo;t display straight quotes even though I wanted to. I would have to update WordPress to remove the <code>wptexture</code> filter. I started this post explaining how easy this was for me, but only proved the point that it is a pain purposely using both proper quotes and dumb straight quotes. Using one or the other is easy.</p>

         	<p>The Wall Street Journal editorial board <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-carrier-shakedown-1480639199">critizies Trump&rsquo;s Carrier deal</a>, calling it a &ldquo;shakedown:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mercantilist Trump trade policy that jeopardized those exports would throw far more Americans out of work than the relatively low-paying jobs he&rsquo;s preserved for now in Indianapolis. Mr. Trump&rsquo;s Carrier squeeze might even cost more U.S. jobs if it makes CEOs more reluctant to build plants in the U.S. because it would be politically difficult to close them.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has now muscled his way into at least two corporate decisions about where and how to do business. But who would you rather have making a decision about where to make furnaces or cars? A company whose profitability depends on making good decisions, or a branding executive turned politician who wants to claim political credit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fully expected them to give Trump a pass. Credit to them for sticking to their principles.</p>
<p>At the Washington Post, Fred Hiatt <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-carrier-deal-is-right-out-of-putins-playbook/2016/12/01/f0456af6-b7e6-11e6-a677-b608fbb3aaf6_story.html">characterized the deal as right out of Putin&rsquo;s playbook</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that about 1,000 Carrier Corp. workers will not be losing their jobs. But there is a whiff of Putinism in the combination of bribery and menace that may have affected Carrier&rsquo;s decision &ndash; the bribery of tax breaks, the menace of potential lost defense contracts for Carrier&rsquo;s parent company, United Technologies.</p>
<p>If this were to become the U.S. government&rsquo;s standard method of operation, the results would be Russian, too: dwindling investment, slowing economic growth, fewer jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been clear that Trump understands bullying, but doesn&rsquo;t care about policy. This deal is a reflection of that. There&rsquo;s no policy or plan to keep  manufacturing jobs; just a willingness to bully and bribe a specific company.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an odd twist that Trump is casting doubt on an election that he legally won (even if it was with a national minority). I attribute that to a strategy of working the ref. The lie of voter fraud is groundwork on propaganda that will be needed in future efforts to suppress voting rights.</p>
<p>It also made me think the same idea applies to the news: Saying that fair journalism is biased is as much a crime against truth as saying that biased journalism is fair.</p>

<p>The focus of left-of-center politics in the dark years to come must be on protecting the groups of people who are targets precisely because of their identities. To sideline their interests is to accede to a backlash that has just begun and will only get worse. If Democrats standing up for diversity makes Trump voters feel disrespected, the best response is a slogan popular among enemies of political correctness at Trump rallies: Fuck your feelings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what&rsquo;s not funny about all this is that we are in a moment of national crisis, in which the developmental stage of the Dirtbag Left might be mistaken for a flash of political wisdom, when prioritization of the (yes, systemic) approaches to reducing racial, gender, and class inequality is most likely to be walked back in the name of distancing the party from the women and people of color who lost the election.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs one trick that everybody who writes sales knows and nobody else seems to know. This trick is so effective that Microsoft Word has it even built in so you can test while you write.</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>The F-K score.</p>

<p>The Flesch-Kincaid score determines what grade level you are writing. If your score is 10, you are writing at a 10th grade reading level. If your score is 12, you are writing at a 12th grade level. And so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, <a href="http://www.readabilitywriter.com">I wrote an app for that</a>. The thing it has over Microsoft Word is that it caculates the F-K score continuously in the background. It also has a couple of tools that suggests how you can improve your score.</p>
<p>I had a very specific use case for that app: a project my wife had in her publishing job. It also does vocabulary tracking, which she needed. Now that her project is over, I find it hard to get motivated to update it. It makes virtually no money. Maybe I should add a Post to Web feature and reposition it as <em>Write Sales Copy That Coverts</em> kind of tool.</p>

Being a snob does not make you sophisticated. Being a snob doesn&rsquo;t even mean you like the subject in question (e.g., wine). It means you use your knowledge of the subject as a means to draw a social distinction between you and other clods you perceive as beneath you.</p>
<p>Maybe The Verge is trying to put down the show&rsquo;s audience (I didn&rsquo;t actually read the article), but I hear it a lot. This usage may have started as a form of ironic self-deprecation, but it has become so overused that I no longer hear that.</p>
<p>How about <em>enthusiast</em>? Of if you really need a word with an air of sophistication, a <em>connoisseur</em>? Of course, you can call yourself anything you want, but if I call you a snob, it won&rsquo;t be a complement.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I finally got my site up and running. I could have launched it a lot sooner, but I decided to take a detour in the realm of VPS providers. It makes sense that one of my first posts would summarize my findings.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a Virtual Private Server (VPS), there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ve looked at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, <a href="https://www.linode.com/linodes">Linode</a>, and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/features/">DigitalOcean</a>. Amazon essentially defined the market. Linone is a longtime darling of the Hacker News crowd. DigitalOcean is the venture capitalist-funded upstart. All are worthy of your business. Here&#8217;s my unscientific, unquantified impression of their relative strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>

<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a smorgasboard of services, of which EC2 is just one. All services are supported by a comprehensive API with client libraries in just about any language you&#8217;re likely to care about. The array of services is their greatest advantage and their greatest weakness. Amazon has the tools to build just about anything you can imagine. Way beyond virtual servers, they have globally distributed CDN, hosted NoSQL and SQL servers, persistant virtualized storage (EBS), a way to declare and instantiate all your services (CloudFormation), and authentication scheme to tie it all together. Even that just scratches the surface. Email, SMS, APNS&#8230;the list goes on. But where to start? It&#8217;s hard to get your head around it all, and it&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed by the information. You have a site to launch; it&#8217;s better not to get too distracted.</p>

<p>EC2 has a reputation for being overpriced and slow. But this is all relative to your use case. EBS is blamed for much of the slowness. I can buy EBS-optimized EC2 instances, but then I&#8217;m in a $50/month/server scenario, and I&#8217;m looking at $10-$20 price range. If I had an infrastructure than could truly take advantage of the flexibility of EBS, and leverage the synergy of complementary AWS services, I&#8217;d probably be happy to pay the difference. In short, it feels like it is built for the likes of Netflix, not the small app builder or blogger.</p>

<p>Also, pricing can be hard to estimate. If you&#8217;re using Amazon&#8217;s pricing estimator, plug in a couple terabytes of outgoing data (the amount you get for free at DigitalOcean and Linode). Your cost just went up a couple of hundred dollars.</p>

<h2>Linode</h2>

<p>Linode was doing VPS before it was cool. They have a dedicated following who praise their tech support. Their web UI is an eyesore but complete. And if you&#8217;re doing it right, you&#8217;re setting up your server with the API instead of the web UI.</p>

<p>Linode exposes their virtualization underpinnings more than others. Setting up a server is a multistsep process. Choose a distribution, initialize a disk, apply the image, boot the image. This reflects the reality, but sometimes I wonder if it would be better to present a more abstract interface.</p>

<p>Linode has a unique initialization process. It uses standard scripts (shell scripts, or python, etc., if you image has that installed). They have special syntax to collect variables via web form (so you can enter the MySQL password, for example), and to include (or &#8220;source&#8221;) other StackScripts. Stackscripts can be shared with the Linode community.</p>

<h2>DigitalOcean</h2>

<p>DigitalOcean is slick and clean. They have a nice UI which feels simple and much less powerful than Linode. Again, you&#8217;re probably using an API instead of the web UI, so it is less important than it might seem.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean supports cloud-init for images that take advantage of it. You can provide a cloud-init configuration file as user data that is available to the image the first time it boots up. It&#8217;s no more functional that Linode&#8217;s stackscripts, but the configuration file is more delcarative, where the StackScript approach is more procedural. It&#8217;s really easy to declare, say, package requirements and let cloud-init take care of the process of installing the package.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean supports associating an SSH public key with your account and have any new image use that public key for login. Linode supports public key insofar as you can add it to a StackScript and put it in the right place, but it was nice to have it build into the deployment process.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a FreeBSD fan DigitalOcean has images for you.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I decided that I was spending to omuch time reading documentatin with AWS. For the most part I had decided on DigitalOcean, and had built up a nice workflow to setup and manage a wordpress installation. My informal benchmarks didn&#8217;t show much of a difference between DigitalOcean and Linode. As it turns out, I don&#8217;t have much of a strong preference between the two. If the workflow offered by Linode fits your style better, I have no doubt you&#8217;d be pleased.</p>

         	<p>I just learned about nc and was so excited I had to write about it. From the man page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP or UDP. It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6. Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates error messages onto standard error instead of sending them to standard output, as telnet(1) does with some.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also communicates with UNIX Domain Sockets easily. I have been using Python for that, but this is easier for simple and one-off tasks.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of my goals in setting up a Wordpress site was to automate the deployment, configuration, and maintentance. More specifically, I wanted the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provider intependence. I should be albe to easily move my site to another hosting provider.</li>
<li>Automanted restore. I couldn&#8217;t be in a posistion where restoring from backup meant manually tapping in SQL load statements.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s more I want to do long-term, but that&#8217;s the bare minimum. The easiest way I found was <a href="http://www.fabfile.org">Fabric</a>. Fabric has a low barrier to entry because it is straigtforwardly build on top of Python functions and the commands on the target machine.</p>

<p>If you need to run <code>apt-get -y install mysql-server</code> on the target host, the Fabric call for that is:</p>

<pre><code>run('apt-get -y install mysql-server')
</code></pre>

<p>To make the command available outside the script (e.g., from the command line), just add it in a function:</p>

<pre><code>def install_msql():
    run('apt-get -y install mysql-server')
</code></pre>

<p>Then from the shell you can run</p>

<pre><code>$ fab install_mysql
</code></pre>

<p>and you computer will connect to the sever and run the <code>apt-get</code> call above.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a little bit more to it in getting your hosts, user, and paswords or keys set up, but it&#8217;s all pretty straightforward. It works over SSH so there&#8217;s no agent to install on the server. </p>

<p>All your functions can be parameterized in pretty obvious ways. Your backup function might look like</p>

<pre><code>def backup(dbname, dbuser):
    run('mysqldump -u {0} {1} &gt; $HOME/{1}.sql'.format(dbuser, dbname))
</code></pre>

<p>There are additional commands to upload and download files, to sync a directory, and other utilities.</p>

<p>There are drawbacks. One is that when I say &#8220;obvious,&#8221; I mean &#8220;obvious if you know Python.&#8221; It helps if you&#8217;re familiar with installing Python packages and some basic syntax.</p>

<p>Another drawback is the lack of <a href="http://lookup.computerlanguage.com/host_app/search?cid=C999999&amp;term=idempotent">idempotence</a>. I can run <code>apt-get -y install mysql-server</code> multiple times without consequence. But if I run the Wordpress cli, <code>wp core install</code> installs wordpress the first time I call it. If I call it again (after the files are already there), it throws an error.</p>

<p>I can live with this for now. I really want the initial setup, which always starts with a clean slate. Extending it modify an existing installation can wait for another day.</p>

         	<p>Default Parameters in Swift</p>

<p>Its the little things that make my life as programmer easier. Like default parameters in Swift. From the The Swift Programming Language (Swift 2.1):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can define a default value for any parameter in a function by assigning a value to the parameter after that parameter‚Äôs type. If a default value is defined, you can omit that parameter when calling the function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was working on a swifty implementation of the DigitalOcean API and I came up with a monster function definition, like this:</p>

<pre><code>func createDropletNamed(name: String,
    region: String = &quot;nyc3&quot;,
    size:String = &quot;512mb&quot;,
    image:String = &quot;ubuntu-14-04-x64&quot;,
    keys:[String] = [],
    backups:Bool = false,
    ipv6:Bool = true,
    userData:String = &quot;&quot;,
    privateNetworking:Bool = false,
    callback:(NSDictionary?, ErrorType?) -&gt; Void = {_,_ in }) {
</code></pre>

<p>In the days of Objecective-C, if I wanted simpler convenience versions of this call, I&#8217;d define additional functions which take fewer arguments,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and then call the monser function by suppliying some defaults. You see that pattern all the time in Objective-C initializers.</p>

<p>Thanks to the magic of default parameters, that&#8217;s not nececcary. Any of the following calls are valid based on the original definition with default arguments:</p>

<pre><code>createDroplenNamed(&quot;devserver1&quot;)

createDropletNamed(&quot;devserver2&quot;, size: &quot;1gb&quot;)

createDropletNamed(&quot;devserver3&quot;) { result, error in
    //handle callback
}
</code></pre>

<p>The swift manual advises lising arameters with default arguments after paramters that always require arguments. Elsewhere, it recommneds that closures always come in the last position to support the trailing closure syntax. Those two rules together imply that if you have a funciton with default arguments and a closure, the closure must take a default argument. Luckily it&#8217;s pretty easy to define an empty closure like <code>{_,_ in }</code>.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#8217;d probably define a function that takes an NSDictionary, but then I&#8217;d lose auto-completion and type checking. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

         	<p>My goals this blog are to develop a habbit of publishing writing and photographs. The key thing to both these activities is to practice regularly and to publish. This is my place to do that.</p>

<p>I used to have a job writing for a living. I was pretty good at it, and I was generally productive. I also enjoyed it. Now my job is coding, not writing. I always intended to keep writing stuff, but that hasn&#8217;t happened. This is an effort to publish a few times a week. I&#8217;m sure that in the beginning meeting that goal will mean publishing some mediocre to poor articles. For now, publishing a poor article is a minor improvement over publishing nothing.</p>

<p>Photography is similar to writing in that I always think I&#8217;m going to do a lot more than I actually do. My goal for photography to post a few pictures every week or two. These will be new pictures I&#8217;ve taken in the previous week, not a dive into my archive. This might include poor photographs taken in my back yard. Again, I consider this a minor improvement over publishing nothing.</p>

<p>For now at least, the goals are personal. I don&#8217;t have any goals of readership or income. I doubt I&#8217;ll every change that for this particular blog.</p>
